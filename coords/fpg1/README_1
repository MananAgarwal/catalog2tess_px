runfpg4:

Command line parameters:

1) camera number (1-4)
2,3,4) Spacecraft attitude specified as RA, Dec (J2000), and roll (all in degrees)
RA and Dec are the direction that gives the spacecraft z-axis direction.
5) (dxy_mm) A length in mm used in computing the derivatives used in the fitting algorithm.
            Use a value equal to the distance across a few CCD pixels.
6) (delchi) Threshold difference of chi square values from one fit iteration to another
            used to determine when to stop the fitting process.
7) (ncon)  Differnce number of fit iterations used when checking the chi square change and
            thereby determining when to stop the fitting process.
8) (pxbor) A star will not be used in the fit if Its image falls in this CCD border
            width in pixels.

Input files: 

1) File "fpg_pars.txt" with a parameter name, on/off flag, and parameter value on each line.
   The parameter values are those used to start the fit.
   The on/off ( = 1/0) flag sets whether a value is allowed to vary in the fitting process.
2) (via stdin) File with one line per star to be used as in the geometric analysis.
   Each line comprises 11 columns,
     Line number
     Star RA (J2000)
     Star Dec (J2000)
     Star RA (J2000) (aberrated)
     Star Dec (J2000) (aberrated)
     magnitude in the TESS band.

     Measured column no. (uses 1-base FITS file pixel numbering)
     Measured row no. (ditto)
     Column pixel no. 1-sigma uncertainty
     Row pixel no. 1-sigma uncertainty

Output files:
1) (via stdout) File with a parameter name, on/off flag, and parameter value on each line.
   The (on) parameter values are those determined in the fit.  The other (off) parameter
   values are those values that were read in.
